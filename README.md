*A GitHub Action to assist in updating MacPorts Portfiles!*

*‚ö†Ô∏è This Action is very early on in development, and is still currently being built. Watch this space! ‚ö†Ô∏è*

This action automatically sends a PR to update a project's Portfile following a new release. 

* For __port maintainers__, this means less time has to be spent manually checking and updating ports.
* For __users__, this makes it easier to get updates for your software as soon as they come out.
* For __software authors__, this helps to make sure the latest version of your software is always being packaged üì¶ .

## Usage Example

```yaml
name: MacPorts Bump Version

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  homebrew:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Bump Version
        uses: harens/action-macports-bump@v1
        with:
          token: ${{secrets.TOKEN}}
          # Name of the port on MacPorts
          name: example
```

## Personal Access Token üéüÔ∏è

### Why this is required

The action runs `gh auth login --with-token` in order to create the PR through the user's account.

### How to Generate

Click [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=read:org,repo,user:email) to generate a Personal Access token with the minimum required scopes for *GitHub cli* to function (`repo` and `read:org`). See the [`gh auth login` docs](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login) for more info about the scopes.

After generating the token, in the project repo page, go to `Settings ‚û§ Secrets ‚û§ New secret`. Paste the value in and give it a name (e.g. TOKEN). Add this token to the workflow file, such as above `${{secrets.TOKEN}}`, where `TOKEN` is the name of the token generated.

## How it works

1) Sets up MacPorts using the [GiovanniBussi/macports-ci](https://github.com/GiovanniBussi/macports-ci) shell script
2) Clones the [macports-ports](https://github.com/macports/macports-ports) repo
3) Installs and authenticates GitHub CLI
4) Creates a [local portfile repo](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/development.local-repositories.html), where the version number and checksums are updated
5) Copies the changes to the main repo, and opens a PR

## Contributing

Any change, big or small, that you think can help improve this action is more than welcome üéâ.

As well as this, feel free to open an issue with any new suggestions or bug reports. Every contribution is appreciated.

## Examples

* This project's [tests.yml](https://github.com/harens/action-macports-bump/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yml)

## TODO

* Add __support for generating binary packages__ that do not require MacPorts on the target system via `sudo port mpkg/mdmg`. Although this is feasible and [well documented](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/using.binaries.html), the issue with this is that it might be hard to generalise this process for many ports and it would make the action much slower.
* Include an __updating dependencies__ feature that could be useful for Go and Cargo packages in particular. This could make use of tools such as [go2port](https://github.com/amake/go2port).

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by [dawidd6/action-homebrew-bump-formula](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-homebrew-bump-formula), a similar GitHub Action for Homebrew.

[GiovanniBussi/macports-ci](https://github.com/GiovanniBussi/macports-ci) also made setting up MacPorts on the fly much simpler. It worked flawlessly and had many advanced flags that were very useful.
